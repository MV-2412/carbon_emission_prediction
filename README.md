# CARBON EMISSION PREDICTION

## Objective

To analyze historical, country-specific parameters and develop accurate models that forecast CO₂ emissions, providing insights that can support climate action, sustainability efforts, and policy planning.

## Project Workflow

The project is structured in two main phases:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Replacing placeholders like `''` and `'..'` with `NaN`
   - Merging and aligning data by country and year
   - Feature selection for model relevance

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling**
   - Visual analysis of emissions by country, year, and parameter
   - Correlation analysis between features and CO₂ emissions
   - Regression modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²
